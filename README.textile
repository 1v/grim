h1. Grim

Grim is a simple gem for extracting (reaping) a page from a pdf and converting it to an image as well as extract the text from the page as a string. It basically gives you an easy to use api to ghostscript, imagemagick, and pdftotext specific to this use case.

h2. Prerequisites

You will need ghostscript, imagemagick, and xpdf installed. On the Mac (OSX) I highly recommend using "Homebrew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ to get them installed, its as simple as "brew install ghostscript imagemagick xpdf".

h2. Usage

<pre><code>
  instance    = Grim.new("/path/to/pdf")
  page_count  = instance.page_count                            # returns the number of pages in the pdf
  png  = instance.page(1).to_image("/path/to/save/image.png")  # saves png to path and returns File instance
  jpeg = instance.page(2).to_image("/path/to/save/image.jpeg") # saves jpeg to path and returns File instance
  text = instance.page(3).text                                 # returns text as a string
</pre></code>
