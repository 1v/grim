h1. Slite

Slite is a simple gem for extracting pages and text from PDF's. It basically gives you an easy to use api to ghostscript and imagemagick specific to this use case.

h2. Prerequisites

You will need ghostscript and imagemagick installed. On the Mac (OSX) I highly recommend using "Homebrew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ to get them installed, its as simple as "brew install ghostscript" and "brew install imagemagick".

h2. Usage

<pre><code>
  instance    = Slite::Pdf.new("/path/to/pdf")
  page_count  = instance.page_count                            # returns the number of pages in the pdf
  png         = instance.page(1).to_png                        # returns png as tempfile instance
  jpeg        = instance.page(2).to_jpeg("/path/to/save/jpeg") # saves jpeg to path and returns file instance
  text        = instance.page(3).text                          # returns text as a string
</pre></code>
